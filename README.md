## Disclaimer
**WIP**

We are trying to address issues opened since months/years on the official Akamai CLI docker image.
Changes implemented here may/will be opinionated, and may not be a good fit for everybody.

At this point in time, we don't commit on any stability / backward compatibility, so use it at your own risk.
